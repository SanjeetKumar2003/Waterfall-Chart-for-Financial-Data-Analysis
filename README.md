 Problem Statement:
 
Your client is a financial analyst who needs to visualize the changes in their
company's profit over a fiscal year.
They have provided you with the initial profit, a series of gains and losses,
and the final profit, and they want you to plot a waterfall chart to illustrate
this data.
Create a Python script that generates the necessary data, processes it, and
produces a waterfall chart to display the financial data.
Write a Python script to achieve the following:
Generate the input data for the initial profit, monthly gains and losses, and
the final profit.
Process this data to calculate the cumulative profit after each gain or loss.
Plot a waterfall chart using Matplotlib to show how each gain or loss
contributes to the overall profit.
You can assume the initial profit is $100,000 and the monthly changes
(gains and losses) are as follows (in dollars): 10,000, -5,000, 15,000,
-10,000, 5,000, -3,000, 20,000, -7,000, 8,000, -4,000, 12,000, -6,000.
The final profit should match the cumulative result of these changes.
The x-axis should represent the months and the y-axis should represent the
profit in dollars.
